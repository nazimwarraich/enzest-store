# Enzest Store Starter (Next.js + Netlify CMS)

This is a simplified starter package for the Enzest store (prepared for Netlify + Netlify CMS).
It includes a minimal Next.js app structure, Netlify CMS config, a placeholder Enzest logo, and demo content.

## Quick mobile-friendly upload instructions
1. Download and unzip `enzest_starter.zip` on your phone.
2. Open your GitHub repo (`enzest-store`) → Add file → Upload files.
   - Upload the **folder contents** (all files and folders), keeping structure.
3. Once files are uploaded to GitHub, go to Netlify → New site -> Import from Git -> connect your repo.
4. Build command: `npm run build`, Publish directory: `.`

For Netlify CMS: enable Netlify Identity and Git Gateway or use GitHub backend. The admin UI is at `/admin` once deployed.
